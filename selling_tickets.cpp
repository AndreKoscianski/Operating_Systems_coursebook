COMMENTARY

To compile, use
 g++ -std=c++11 -pthread selling_tickets.cpp


This small program illustrates the "selling tickets problem".

Run the code, you should obtain different values each time.

Pay attention to constants A and B.

These constants may need to be increased, as faster CPUs are built.

For relatively small values of A and B, all the A*B loops are
executed by the microprocessor without context switching.

In other words, A*B must be such that interleaved execution will occur.

As a reference, 
in the computer I used for the tests execution took less than 0.2 seconds,
and this was enough to trigger the problem.
